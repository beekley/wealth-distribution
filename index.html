      The graph below shows the wealth held by households in the US (bars) compared to common-ish expenses and other fun costs. The different colors represent groups of 20% of American households, plus a bar for the top 1% of households.

      If you have a household wealth in the green range, you are in the top fifth of wealthiest Americans. You are likely considered at least middle class and possibly upper-class, depending on where you live. You can comfortably buy a luxury car, own a condo or suburban home, and are on track for a nice retirement. To get here, you've had to earn well over the median wage or inherited something.

      Despite your large wealth, you are not peers with the top 1%. They can buy vintage racing cars, or homes in the most expensive neighborhoods in the world, or retire with annual investment returns about the size of your entire net worth. They can own jets and fund successful political campaigns without raising a dollar. Even with a high paying job at a top tech company, you wouldn't get there in a lifetime.

      (And even they are not peers with billionaires, who make in a minute what they may in a year)

      Now let's look at the average household, the orange middle 20%, the "real Americans". This group can buy a new SUV, but it's a large fraction of their net worth and deprecates in value every year. In the 80s, they could buy a home and comfortably pay for state college tuition. But in 2020, they'll have to take out loans worth several times their net worth to pay for it. Much of the country is simply too expensive to live and retirement seems impossibly far away.
